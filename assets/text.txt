        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I am a Full-Stack/Frontend developer based in Buffalo NY. I am
          interested in interactive design,user experience and new technologies.
          I like art,music, and martial arts. Graduating with a general
          engineering in software engineering gives me a great understanding of
          many different science and math subjects. To around myself out even
          more, I also have a minor in pre-law and have skills in visual arts,
          such as drawing and film.
